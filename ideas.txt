   - stochastic generation:
     - use simplex noise [1] (low-freq) for oceans + rocks, variable tolerance means that edge is all ocean
     - use simplex noise [2] (low-freq) for biomes - use for tree density (shortened down for percent chance of trees)
     - for all rocks tiles, 5% chance of becoming iron
     - pick locations randomly until one is found with:
       - space for an HQ (trees / plains, replace trees with plains)
       - within 5 of water
     - pick nearest water block and replace with shipwreck
 - tower defence
